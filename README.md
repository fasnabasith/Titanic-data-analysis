Data exploration of the Titanic passenger data focusing on survival trends and feature relationships.

# Titanic Dataset - Exploratory Data Analysis

## Description

This project involves exploratory data analysis (EDA) on the Titanic dataset to understand factors affecting passenger survival. The dataset contains passenger details such as age, gender, passenger class, fare, and port of embarkation, along with survival status.

## Tools and Libraries Used

- Python  
- Pandas  
- NumPy  
- Matplotlib  
- Seaborn  

## Data Cleaning and Preparation

The dataset was checked for missing values and duplicates. Columns with excessive missing data, such as cabin information, were removed to maintain data quality. Missing values in important columns like age were handled appropriately to ensure accurate analysis.

## Exploratory Data Analysis Process

Visualizations including count plots, histograms, boxplots, and a correlation heatmap were used to uncover patterns and relationships within the data. These visualizations helped in identifying trends related to survival and other passenger attributes.

## Key Insights

- The dataset showed a clear difference in survival rates between genders, with females having a noticeably higher chance of survival compared to males.  
- Passenger class was an important factor, with higher class passengers tending to survive more often than those in lower classes.  
- Age distribution revealed that younger passengers had better survival prospects compared to older passengers.  
- The port where passengers embarked showed variation in survival, suggesting it plays a role in passenger outcomes  
- Correlation analysis indicated that passenger class and fare paid were among the most influential numeric factors related to survival, while other features had weaker relationships.
